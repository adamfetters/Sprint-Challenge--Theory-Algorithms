# Exercise 1

a) The amount of times ran will be equivalent of (n _ n / n).
Example if n = 5. 5 _ 5* 5 = 125. If you add 5 * 5 (25) to a, it will only be 5 runs until a is greater than the conditional. If you do 10 _ 10 _ 10 (1000) , you will add 10 \* 10 (100) to a each time and get 10 steps before the condition is met. So it seems that doubling n, therefore doubles the number of steps. The run time is linear in that it grows in direct proportion to what N is.
